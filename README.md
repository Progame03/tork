# Tork
A semi-arcade vehicle system for Unity

# Intro
This is a branch of Tork Vehicle Dynamics originally made by [Adrenak](https://github.com/adrenak/tork) which targets semi-arcade style games

This Iteration of Tork improves/changes many things like stability with high masses and velocity and also will include tools for modding the game "My Summer Car"
If you want to easily implement this into your existing projects, you can use the Unitypackages provided in the releases-page!
